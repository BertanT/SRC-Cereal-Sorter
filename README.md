# SRC-Cereal-Sorter
The TensorFlow Cereal Sorter Project at the Stevens Robotics Club

**Requires Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye 2023-02-21 on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a Camera Module V3 and Coral USB Accelerator as it is the newest version that still supports PyCoral and picamera2 at the same time without wokrarounds!**

**Included TFLite model is not well-optimized for cereal recognition. Better model and detailed documentation on how to train your own are coming soon.**
